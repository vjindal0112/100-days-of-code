# 100 Days Of Code - Log


<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created new create-react-app with Bulma to test the iTunes api. Started reading the react documentation from the very beginning. Learning by doing worked only to a point. I'm still confused so reading the conceptual guide should help clarify everything.

**Thoughts** I need to restart from the basics, I think everything will make a lot more sense. Glad I have started that. Looking forward to continuing.

### Day 2: October 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to create a stateful component and got input from an input. Learned the basics of hooks, don't totally understand them yet.

**Thoughts** Getting some cors error for fetching, need to look into that. This is fun, gotta stick with this long term. Hope to get some data soon.

### Day 3: October 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Understood cors and security policies, successfully got json from both iTunes and audiodb api's. Both are insufficient.

**Thoughts** API calls are making a ton more sense now. Need to look into spotify api with possible flask server for auth?

### Day 4: October 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read a little about post requests and the spotify API. Learned what a promise in React is.

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit of a slow day. Had to fit in time during dance practice which didn't end in much efficiency. Hope to make more tangible progress tomorrow.

### Day 5: October 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spun my wheels a little with client-side post requests, read more and tried a couple things

### Day 6: October 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out that post requests to the Spotify API from the client-side are blocked. Would need to make server-side calls for it to work. Also learned what Postman does.

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Samay, I am out of the rut.
