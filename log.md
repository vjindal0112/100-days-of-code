# 100 Days Of Code - Log


<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created new create-react-app with Bulma to test the iTunes api. Started reading the react documentation from the very beginning. Learning by doing worked only to a point. I'm still confused so reading the conceptual guide should help clarify everything.

**Thoughts** I need to restart from the basics, I think everything will make a lot more sense. Glad I have started that. Looking forward to continuing.

### Day 2: October 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to create a stateful component and got input from an input. Learned the basics of hooks, don't totally understand them yet.

**Thoughts** Getting some cors error for fetching, need to look into that. This is fun, gotta stick with this long term. Hope to get some data soon.

### Day 3: October 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Understood cors and security policies, successfully got json from both iTunes and audiodb api's. Both are insufficient.

**Thoughts** API calls are making a ton more sense now. Need to look into spotify api with possible flask server for auth?

### Day 4: October 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read a little about post requests and the spotify API. Learned what a promise in React is.

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit of a slow day. Had to fit in time during dance practice which didn't end in much efficiency. Hope to make more tangible progress tomorrow.

### Day 5: October 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spun my wheels a little with client-side post requests, read more and tried a couple things

**Thoughts**: Not much progress, need to experiment more with post requests

### Day 6: October 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out that post requests to the Spotify API from the client-side are blocked. Would need to make server-side calls for it to work. Also learned what Postman does.

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Samay, I am out of the rut.

### Day 7: October 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally was able to get all Spotify api calls to work. Unfortunately it seems that Spotify does not allow one to get the genre of a track using their api. However, many other metrics are available. Tons of song analysis and metrics that could possibly identify fills anyway.

**Thoughts**: Not having the genre is a big hit. Might have to look into how to analyze a song to get the genre.

### Day 8: October 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Applied for my app to be on the ArtsEngin newsletter. Hope to talk to some drummers soon. Today, I started a flask server app for fun. I read a little about CRUD applications, a little about react-router, and a little about flask requests. Wasn't able to implement any of it yet.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a little to figure out what I wanted to work on. Should plan out my hour of code so I am more efficient during it. Need to set more action-ables.

### Day 8: October 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed an algorithm to check whether a Sudoku grid is valid or not. Checks for numbers being in range and for repeated numbers in wrong places.

**Thoughts**: Brute forced it mostly. Was able to utilize sets to make for faster checking of <element> in <set>
