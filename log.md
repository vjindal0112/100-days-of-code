**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created new create-react-app with Bulma to test the iTunes api. Started reading the react documentation from the very beginning. Learning by doing worked only to a point. I'm still confused so reading the conceptual guide should help clarify everything.

**Thoughts** I need to restart from the basics, I think everything will make a lot more sense. Glad I have started that. Looking forward to continuing.
