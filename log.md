# 100 Days Of Code - Log


<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->


### Day 1: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created new create-react-app with Bulma to test the iTunes api. Started reading the react documentation from the very beginning. Learning by doing worked only to a point. I'm still confused so reading the conceptual guide should help clarify everything.

**Thoughts** I need to restart from the basics, I think everything will make a lot more sense. Glad I have started that. Looking forward to continuing.

### Day 2: October 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to create a stateful component and got input from an input. Learned the basics of hooks, don't totally understand them yet.

**Thoughts** Getting some cors error for fetching, need to look into that. This is fun, gotta stick with this long term. Hope to get some data soon.

### Day 3: October 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Understood cors and security policies, successfully got json from both iTunes and audiodb api's. Both are insufficient.

**Thoughts** API calls are making a ton more sense now. Need to look into spotify api with possible flask server for auth?

### Day 4: October 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read a little about post requests and the spotify API. Learned what a promise in React is.

**Thoughts**: Today was a bit of a slow day. Had to fit in time during dance practice which didn't end in much efficiency. Hope to make more tangible progress tomorrow.

### Day 5: October 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spun my wheels a little with client-side post requests, read more and tried a couple things

**Thoughts**: Not much progress, need to experiment more with post requests

### Day 6: October 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out that post requests to the Spotify API from the client-side are blocked. Would need to make server-side calls for it to work. Also learned what Postman does.

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Samay, I am out of the rut.

### Day 7: October 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally was able to get all Spotify api calls to work. Unfortunately it seems that Spotify does not allow one to get the genre of a track using their api. However, many other metrics are available. Tons of song analysis and metrics that could possibly identify fills anyway.

**Thoughts**: Not having the genre is a big hit. Might have to look into how to analyze a song to get the genre.

### Day 8: October 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Applied for my app to be on the ArtsEngin newsletter. Hope to talk to some drummers soon. Today, I started a flask server app for fun. I read a little about CRUD applications, a little about react-router, and a little about flask requests. Wasn't able to implement any of it yet.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a little to figure out what I wanted to work on. Should plan out my hour of code so I am more efficient during it. Need to set more action-ables.

### Day 9: October 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed an algorithm to check whether a Sudoku grid is valid or not. Checks for numbers being in range and for repeated numbers in wrong places.

**Thoughts**: Brute forced it mostly. Was able to utilize sets to make for faster checking of <element> in <set>

### Day 10: October 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read and introduced myself to Binary Search Trees. Also, set up a phone call with a drummer and have another potential phone call.

**Thoughts**: Binary Search Trees are a super interesting data structure. I still do not know why they are used or what they are used for. Lots more to learn. Also need to map out what I want to ask each of the drummers I talk to.

### Day 11: October 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Set up a phone call with another drummer. Also learned a little more about Binary Search Trees. Did an Easy LeetCode problem as well.

**Thoughts**: The Easy LeetCode problem took longer than expected. I should read up on more algorithms and data structures.

### Day 12: October 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the python collections library a bit and implemented a hash map algorithm on HackerRank.

**Thoughts**: Collections library is pretty cool, defaultdict makes hash map creation very simple

### Day 13: October 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After looking over my notes from my conversations with drummers, I might pivot my app to be more of a learning repository with the most influential drum solos and transcriptions of solos / marching band rhythms.

**Thoughts**: Need to talk to even more drummers.

### Day 14: October 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created my first chrome extension today! Able to get options page and changing body background color functionality.

**Thoughts**: Hopefully can continue with this with Reflect (our project for MHacks). Currently Drum App is on hold until further ideation - maybe flesh out more with Ben from Compology?

### Day 15: October 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started flushing out a startup idea for MBC. Feeling good because our idea seems to have a market as indicated by a similar business that recently raised 21 mil. Additionally learned what Whitepapers and about the ecosystem of the block chain space.

**Thoughts**: David Sun is so knowledgable. It was so fun to talk to him for an hour and a half at Shift.

### Day 16: October 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started to understand our intended market better for our MBC idea. Learned what sandboxing is for code. Learned a little about NumPy. Failed to install gVisor - needed to chown to root. Might explore another installation method.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning a ton from MBC.

### Day 17: November 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Created another Chrome Extension, this one was a simple person media site launcher. It looks pretty nice.

**Thoughts**: Starting to understand the architecture of Chrome Extensions. Going to try to get some timing of web pages done tomorrow.

### Day 18: November 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned some more about Chrome Extension Architecture. Learned tons about the Stock market from Yash Pande, including ETF funds, IPOs, shorting stocks, market cap, different sectors, quants, general trends and more. Also called up Srdjan, it was nice to reconnect with him and Prakash.

**Thoughts**: Yash is so knowledgable about this stuff. Very cool to talk to him.

### Day 19: November 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started my own custom Chrome Extension. Learned how tabId works, how to test background scripts, and more about event handlers.

**Thoughts**: Will try to figure out more with timing tomorrow.

### Day 20: November 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little more about Chrome extensions tabs, starting to implement the webNavigation API

**Thoughts**: Still need to figure out timing

### Day 21: November 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to isolate website name from new tabs added to history.

**Thoughts**: Now have to figure out how to time it, and how to safely store that data.

### Day 22: November 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little more about content scripts and how they are injected into the webpage. Still need to implement.

**Thoughts**: Seems like there is a lot more reading to do if I want to interact with firebase for data storage.

### Day 23: November 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple chrome extension that changes the background color of all p tags on a page to purple with a content script.

**Thoughts**: Have a more solid understanding of how content scripts are injected.

### Day 24: November 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Made a class for each website to keep track of visited sites. Learned about objects and classes in javascript.

**Thoughts**: Still don't understand how to organize the classes into separate files. It doesn't seem to be as simple as importing the file into another higher level file.
